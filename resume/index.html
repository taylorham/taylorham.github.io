		<h1>summary</h1>
		<p>With five years of customer service experience, and as a manager for the last 3 years, I feel that my strong drive to lead and sense of pride in all I do makes me a strong candidate for any position. I'm passionate about learning every facet of the skills I need to do a job efficiently and correctly, and tackle problem-solving with excitement. As a team member I'm great at diffusing stress, encouraging, and enabling my peers to do the best work they can. As a leader I'm compassionate but firm, and have a proven ability to innovate and inspire.</p>

			<p> Hobbies include: playing disc golf, singing and playing guitar or drums, designing and creating 3d art for video games, "evaluating" video games, learning about new science and technologies, playing with animals, incredibly amateur comedy, and critically picking apart irritating design. Very easygoing and resilient in the face of stress. Great at parties.</p>
